// first test-- this test is checking if there is a function named 'divide'

const divide = function(a,b) {
    return a/b
}

//explanation we're using the 'const' keyword to declare a function expression named 'divide' this function takes in two parameters 'a' and 'b' and returns their division

// second test - this test wants to make sure that when the 'divide' function is called with '2000' and '100' as arguments it returns '20'



//this is the same formula as above, it just has numbers on it now to satisfy the  test

// test number 3 - this test is checkinig to see if we have a function named 'square'

const square = x => x*x

// explanation we are using the 'const' keyword to declare an arrow function named 'square' this funciton takes in one parameter 'x' and returns its square ('x * x')

// test 5 - this test is checking if there is an arrow function named 'add'

const add = (a, b) => a + b

// explanation - we are using the 'const' keyword to declare an arrow function named 'add' this function takes in 2 parameters a and b and returns their sum
